# SpheraSense

SpheraSense is designed to assist researchers in analyzing cell spheroids grown in laboratory conditions. The software will incorporate machine learning models to automatically detect, measure, and track spheroid parameters over time from z-stacks of microscopy images. The goal is to enhance data throughput and the speed of analysis when running spheroid formation and treatment experiments.

# MVP:

- Upload a folder of images
  - Recognizes Z planes and wells
- Manual image sort
  - Click through images individually, discarding option
- Get spheroid size over time data
  - Implement some object recognition here
  - Write data to csv file
- Display spheroid data on a graph
  - Save graph as .pdf
  - Save data as .csv
